Workflow:
	Github Issues are created to implement a certain feature, review functionality or fix a bug
	The person assigned to the issue starts a new branch to solve ONLY that issue (Branch name should be the number of the issue for further reference)
	After making the necessary changes, the assignee can issue a Pull Request to merge the changes back into "master"
	The Pull Request is reviewed and further changes to the branch may be recommended
	After all changes have been made, the pull request is approved and the asignee may merge the branch back into "master" and safely delete the branch
		
Other:
	Code Documentation will rely on JavaDocs
