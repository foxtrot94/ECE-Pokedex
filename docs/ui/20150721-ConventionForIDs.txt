Convention for the ID names of XML UI elements in Android

Summary:
To create a uniform way of accessing UI elements from code, frontend development should follow the following
    "[XMLTypeName]_[ElementDescriptiveName]"
Where:  [XMLTypeName] refers to the class type of the XML element
        [ElementDescriptiveName] is a short but stateful name of what the element does

The justification behind such convention is that
1. The XML Type Name will provide a straightforward indicator of what the element should be casted to from Java code without needing to flip back and forth between .java and .xml files
2. The descriptive name can be used to infer what the button does in the actual layout without a need to guess

Example:
"button_browsenow" (Could also be named "button_browse_now" but not "button_browse.now")
"linearlayout_evolution-chain" (An abbreviation such as "linlayout_evolutions" might be preferable)

Notes:
-Layouts should not have ID unless they are to be manipulated from code (To add children into them, for example)
-Certain static elements of UI (e.g. Headers, Titles, Subtitles) may not always exhibit this convention, but should still be found by a unique ID
