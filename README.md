An android app for those that want to be the very best

Android App built using API 19 (Android 4.2.2 "Kit Kat") on Android Studio
The application contains a complete reference to all 718 available Pokemon as of January 2015.   


Building   
Use the Android SDK with API 19 to build. After build, package the .apk   


Installing   
Test through Google adb within Android Studio or manually pass the .apk to the device storage.    


The apk provides a lightweight database that is copied over at first run and is subsuquently used to query full Pokemon data locally, with the possibility of expansion, cross-reference between games and much more extensibility.
